    <string name="anabaslik">Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high.
        Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat.
        Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.
        Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well.
        Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.</string>

    <string name="diabetes_yazı">Diabetes mellitus is a widespread disease that causes the emergence of many deadly diseases.\n\n Hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) and hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) are critical stages for diabetes as they may cause malfunctioning in the human body.\n\n In this study, we propose to employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) for blood glucose prediction of next time steps to let diabetes patients take action before the glucose level reaches the critical stages. \n\n The proposed RNN includes two subsequent Long-Short Term Memory models with two fully attached layers to improve the prediction accuracy. This network was later integrated with our custom-design Android application capable of reading the blood glucose from the sensors via Bluetooth. \n\n The application sends the blood glucose level to the server via a cloud system to predict the next glucose level for the patient.\n\n The prediction result comes back to the Android application via the cloud system to evaluate whether the blood glucose level has a tendency to reach the critical stages. In case of this tendency is detected, the application alerts the patient for necessary precautions. Real data collected from diabetes patients were used to train the proposed network and experimental results show that prediction for the next time step can be predicted with the error less than 3.72 mg/dl which corresponds to 95.6% accuracy.\n\n In addition, a comparison was made with a traditional neural network and the proposed network outperformed in terms of accuracy.</string>

    <string name="whatarethetypes">What are the different types of diabetes?</string>
    <string name="themosttypes">The most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.</string>
    <string name="type_1_diabetes">Type 1 diabetes</string>
    <string name="type1yazı">If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.</string>
    <string name="type_2_diabetes">Type 2 diabetes</string>
    <string name="type2yazı">If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.</string>
    <string name="how_common_is_diabetes">How common is diabetes?</string>
    <string name="commondiabetes">As of 2015, 30.3 million people in the United States, or 9.4 percent of the population, had diabetes. More than 1 in 4 of them didn’t know they had the disease. Diabetes affects 1 in 4 people over the age of 65. About 90-95 percent of cases in adults are type 2 diabetes.1</string>
    <string name="what_are_the_symptoms_of_diabetes">What are the symptoms of diabetes?</string>
    <string name="syptomps">Symptoms of diabetes include:\n \n increased thirst and urination\n \n increased hunger\n \n fatigue\n \n blurred vision\n \n numbness or tingling in the feet or hands\n \n sores that do not heal\n \n unexplained weight loss\n \nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly—over the course of several years—and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or heart trouble.</string>
